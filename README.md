3. Create a User Profile, adding in the relevant Tenant Information
    * Once accepted, your Apartment Information will be added to your complete Profile

    * Full Access can be obtained from your Profile (see Common Questions below for more details)

# Common Questions

## As a Tenant, how would I submit a Maintenance Request?

If your apartment is in need of maintenance, or fails to reach the standards detailed in your tenant agreement, you can submit a Maintenance Request from your User Profile on the website!  

Once submitted, you will see all active requests, where yours is waiting in line of others (if any), and can even update/delete them as needed.

## Can I view the website if I am not a user/signed in?

Yes, but you will be limited to general information about HoneyBadger Towers! Once you create a profile, and are accepted as a tenant, you will unlock greater functionality within the website itself!
